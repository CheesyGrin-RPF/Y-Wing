#Studio Scale Y-Wing Project

Here you'll find files for planning and building a studio scale Y-Wing model, 1/24 in scale model terms. These files were originally created by DaveG (RPF member) and made open source in 2016. Since then, many builders from all over the world have embarked on buildng their own Y-Wing using DaveGs files as a base. 

Some builders have contributed to the project by developing additional assets. These contributions have helped improve and grow the project. However, finding these assets requires a time-consuming review of numerous RPF threads. DaveG created a sticky thread on the RPF that compiled many of the builds: https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/the-one-stop-y-wing-thread.264959/. It's a convenient mechanism for seeing various build threads, part maps, and reference materials. However, it still requires a builder to comb each thread for file updates that builder may have contributed. This GitHub repository is an attempt to compile and centralize the files needed to complete a studio scale Y-Wing. 

Disclaimer: This is a public repository created to help Y-Wing builders get started and benefit from a community knowledgebase. There is no claim to perfection with any of these files. They're meant to represent the Y-Wing filming miniature as accurately as possible but still leaving room for individual perference. Feel free to contribute to this repository. Most importantly, enjoy building this iconic starship from Star Wars!
